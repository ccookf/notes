# Notes
A simple expressjs site to take notes.

Todo:
- Settle on note design, probably date -> memo.
- Store notes per user in a collection.
- Have a user page display notes.
- (Preferably on same page) have a form for submitting a new note.
- Easy delete notes.

Stretch goals:
- Unify the page designs and add a navbar.
- Registration page.
- Password security.
