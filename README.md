# Notes
A simple expressjs site to take notes.  Built on Node, Express, Bootstrap, Angular, and running on AWS ~~[here](http://ccookf.com)~~ Probably broken while I dip my toes into some really weird issues with ssl.

### Installation
Open a command line to the repository and run `npm install` for dependencies.  Then run the server with `node bin/www` or using your process manager of choice.  Acess through the express default port (ie. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

### License
In the strange situation anyone actually wants to use this, MIT.  Have fun?
